**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Memory-First Compliance
- [ ] Design relies primarily on in-memory data structures for initial implementation
- [ ] Persistence complexity deferred to later phases where appropriate
- [ ] Business logic remains clear and testable without storage concerns

### Incremental Evolution Compliance
- [ ] Design builds directly on previous phase concepts without breaking core abstractions
- [ ] Architecture supports phased evolution from console → web → AI → cloud
- [ ] Core domain concepts maintain backward compatibility across phases

### Simplicity-First Compliance
- [ ] Design avoids premature complexity from frameworks/databases/distributed systems
- [ ] Implementation favors simple, explicit logic over clever solutions
- [ ] Technology choices match phase-appropriate complexity level

### Separation of Concerns Compliance
- [ ] Business logic is isolated from storage, API, UI, and AI components
- [ ] Clean architectural boundaries maintained between system components
- [ ] Independent evolution of components is supported

### Production Readiness Compliance
- [ ] Later phases include containerization, orchestration, and observability
- [ ] Professional standards for deployment and maintenance are planned
- [ ] Real-world engineering practices are incorporated

### AI-Native Mindset Compliance
- [ ] AI capabilities are designed into system architecture from the beginning
- [ ] Agents are treated as first-class system components
- [ ] Traceability and auditability of AI actions are planned

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
